# Code Quality Analyzer

An advanced static code analysis tool that evaluates code quality, detects potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and suggests improvements across multiple programming languages.

## Features

- Parses source code into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) for structural analysis.
- Uses Machine Learning to detect bugs and security vulnerabilities.
- Applies NLP to analyze code comments and naming conventions.
- Supports multiple programming languages (currently Python).
- Dockerized for easy deployment.
- Provides REST API and CLI interface.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- AST module for code parsing
- Machine Learning (placeholder for future models)
- NLP with transformers (placeholder)
- FastAPI for REST API
- Docker & Docker Compose
